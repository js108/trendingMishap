# Trending Mishap
*A bot who wants to be part of the conversation (but all it knows are twitter trends)*

[The Site](https://trending-mishap.herokuapp.com/) | [The Bot](https://twitter.com/trending_mishap)

This repo contains a twitter bot and a website that combine random twitter trends to create strange aleatory tweets. It's written in javascript using node and react.

## How it works

The node app (index.js) has three routines, which are in the /myModules directory:

**trendComposer.js** Composes functions that search the twitter api, clean up the data, and save it to the json that the other routines will use.

**botComposer.js** Composes functions that read the json, write a tweet, and tweet it via the bot.

**tweetReader.js** Reads the json and sends it to the react site when requested.

All the react stuff lives in the /client directory. The main app is /client/src/App.js. It calls /myModules/tweetReader.js via /index.js everytime someone visits and presents them with an interface that lets them write and tweet their own mishaps.

The relevant files are commented if you feel like taking a look.

## How to make your own

1. install node, react, and yarn

2. git clone https://github.com/js108/trendingMishap.git

3. cd trendingmishap

4. yarn install

5. set up your twitter apps and url endpoints in .env-example

6. yarn start (to start your node server)

7. (in a second terminal window â€” you need to run both servers at once) cd client

8. yarn start (to start yr react server)

That should get your dev environment running.

The info on how to trigger BOT_ENDPOINT and TREND_ENDPOINT is in .env-example. I have BOT_ENDPOINT running once an hour which seems like a reasonably humble tweet volume. And I trigger TREND_ENDPOINT every 15 minutes so that when people visit the site the trends are fresh. If you run TREND_ENDPOINT more than ~12 times an hour twitter will limit you and the new data won't come through fyi. TREND_ENDPOINT runs trendComposer.js and BOT_ENDPOINT runs botComposer.js as you might've guessed.

I set up the app based on this article [Create React App with Express in Production](https://daveceddia.com/create-react-app-express-production) which was super helpful and has further info about how to deploy to heroku. This page will tell you how to configure your heroku env variables [Configuration and Config Vars](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars).
